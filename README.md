# HR-Data-Analytics-End-to-End-Project

## Description:
This project represents a comprehensive data analysis endeavor utilizing Python for Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine Learning. It was undertaken as the final project for the Programming for Data Analysis and Science Computing course at Foreign Trade University.

## About the Dataset:
The HR Analytics dataset offers insights into organizational trends and helps HR departments address challenges like attrition. Machine learning models can predict potential attrition cases, aiding in employee retention efforts.

## Project Highlights:
- Utilized Python for cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of a substantial dataset of HR data sourced from a multinational company.
- Applied a range of Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to explore the dataset, creating interactive dashboards and charts for enhanced visualization.
- Built and evaluated predictive machine learning models using scikit-learn and statsmodels to tackle various HR challenges such as employee turnover, performance, and satisfaction.
- Employed advanced techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and feature selection to optimize the machine learning models.
- Presented the project's findings and recommendations in a clear and concise report format using Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for enhanced collaboration and dissemination of results.

## Tools/Languages/Libraries Used:
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
