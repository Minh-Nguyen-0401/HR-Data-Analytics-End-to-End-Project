# HR-Data-Analytics-End-to-End-Project

## Description:
This project represents a comprehensive data analysis endeavor utilizing Python for Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine Learning. It was undertaken as the final project for the Programming for Data Analysis and Science Computing course at Foreign Trade University, for which I was scored 9.5/10 (with 4.0 GPA overall).

## About the Dataset:
The HR Analytics dataset offers insights into organizational trends and helps HR departments address challenges like attrition. Machine learning models can predict potential attrition cases, aiding in employee retention efforts.
> **Attributes within the relation**:
> - Overtime
> - Marital Status
> - Job Role
> - Gender
> - Education Field
> - Department
> - Business Travel
> - Relation between Overtime and Age
> - Total Working Years
> - Education Level
> - Number of Companies Worked
> - Distance from Home

## Project Structure:
1. **`README.md`**:  The introductory file containing quintessential information about the dataset and orientation of the project
2. **`HR_analytics_final Basic to Advanced EDA & Machine Learning Models.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing comprehensive data transformation and analysis operations, in conjunction with in-details analysis and results intepretation conducive to insightful findings gathering procedure
3. **`Analytic Figures`**: A compilation folder containing all the necessary figures selected during the analysis process that might cater to future reporting or presentation demands

## Project Highlights:
- Utilized Python for cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of a substantial dataset of HR data sourced from a multinational company.
- Applied a range of Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to explore the dataset, creating interactive dashboards and charts for enhanced visualization.
- Built and evaluated predictive machine learning models using scikit-learn and statsmodels to tackle various HR challenges such as employee turnover, performance, and satisfaction. Also, statistical analysis is performed to assessment the degree of influence of various features (overtime, monthly rate, frequency of business travel, etc) on attrition rate
- Employed advanced techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and feature selection to optimize the machine learning models.
- Presented the project's findings and recommendations in a clear and concise report format using Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for enhanced collaboration and dissemination of results.

## Tools/Languages/Libraries Used:
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
